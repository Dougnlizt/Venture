Lottery tool for TJCS

Near the end of 2017, Thomas Jefferson Charter School began looking for an alternative to their current lottery tool used for randomly selecting students from the list of those on the wait list to get into TJCS.  The primary drive is the concern for compatibility of the tool with newer OS's and technology being used at the school.

Following approval from the school board, requirements and tool design began in January of 2018.  The first version was provided by the end of February.  The source code is in Java to ensure long-term compatibility and provided here when a newer version is needed.
